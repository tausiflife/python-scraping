### python-scraping
# This sample web scraping which searches a key word in the google and makes an csv file with list obtained.

1. To install using ansible, go inside the ansible directory inside the project.
`cd ansible`. Then run the following command - 
`ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml -v`
 
2. To install manually using pip run the `install.sh` file:- 
`chmod 0700 install.sh` then 
`./install.sh`
